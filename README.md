## Development

To get a local copy of the code, clone it using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/zehan12/contacts-web-app.git
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Now, you can start a local web server by running:

```
yarn start
```

And then open http://localhost:8000 to view it in the browser.
